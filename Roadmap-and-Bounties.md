Also, welcome your suggestions for adding things to this Roadmap - please open an issue.

Another way to contribute is to donate to our ethereum address to help
us fund more bounties!

`0x86aDA9f4FB7b547053346d5E96B29370405d05CE` - Ether and also any other type of tokens are welcome.

Note: Due to high fees & network congestion which make bitcoin impractical for small transactions, in the future, 
bounty payouts will be moving to Ethereum. The bitcoin address will be drained first,
and then switch the bounty awards to quote in ETH.
